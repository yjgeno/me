<!-- ### My 101 -->
Hello, my name is Yongjian Yang (杨　永健). I am currently a final-year Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M University, where I am researching on computation biology with machine learning in [Cailab](https://cailab-tamu.github.io) under the supervision of [Dr. James Cai](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/james-cai.html). <br>
Before returning to campus, I worked in Japan and gained valuable experience within the healthcare industry [see my [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11511246B2/en)]. This experience has taught me to be a quick learner with excellent time/task management skills, which has enabled me to participate in a variety of R&D projects. In addition, I am a team player with cooperative skills honed through working with individuals of diverse backgrounds and cultures. 日本語も喋ります。<br>
I believe that my desire to solve difficult problems and my innovative critical thinking will be beneficial to the areas on which I am concentrating my efforts.

### More about me
I am a big football (soccer) fan, and I was fortunate enough to watch the 2018 World Cup final in Russia. In US, I rise early on the weekends to watch the Premier League, from the thrill of a last-second goal to the tactical battles.<br>
I also like exploring different tonkotsu (豚骨) ramen restaurants in Japan and around world. There is something truly special about the rich, savory broth and tender noodles that keep me coming back for more.
